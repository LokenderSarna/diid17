## Assignment 1 Guidance:

Download `DIID17-PS1.ipynb` to get started with the first assignment. If you're new to Jupyter notebooks, please work through a tutorial or two (such as [this one](http://opentechschool.github.io/python-data-intro/core/notebook.html) *before* you get started on this assignment. If you're new to git/GitHub, don't worry, you don't need to do anything fancy for this problem set.
